## Why Google Gemini Omni?

**Google Gemini Omni** is a leap beyond specialized video models because it is Google's true omni-modal system — one model that ingests text, images, audio, and video, and outputs video grounded in real-world knowledge.

- **Native multimodality** — Mix text, reference images, audio tracks, and source clips in a single prompt
- **Character consistency** — Faces, outfits, and props stay coherent across scenes, lighting, and actions
- **Reference-based editing** — Apply a style image, transfer motion from a clip, or swap an environment with plain language
- **Conversational remixing** — Iterate with chat-style follow-ups like "make the last 3 seconds slower" or "swap the city for Tokyo at night"
- **Audio-grounded lip-sync** — Provide a voice track and Omni animates accurate mouth shapes and timing
- **Physics-aware** — Better grasp of gravity, momentum, fluids, and cloth than older diffusion-only video models

## Video Edit (Restyle & Remix)

Provide a source clip (`video_url`) and optionally reference images (`image_urls`) — Gemini Omni rewrites the scene while preserving the original motion and timing. Source clip: max 30 s, 100 MB. Trim window: max 10 s.

**API call:**
```python
video_url = api.upload_file("source_clip.mp4")
job = api.video_edit(
    prompt="<prompt below>",
    video_url=video_url,
    trim_start=0,
    trim_end=8,
    duration=8,
    aspect_ratio="16:9",
)
```

### Studio Ghibli Restyle

**Prompt:**
```
Restyle the entire clip as a hand-drawn Studio Ghibli animation. Preserve the original camera motion and timing exactly. Convert all textures to soft watercolor washes, add gentle cel-shaded outlines, sky becomes a painted pastel gradient, any characters take on Ghibli proportions and large expressive eyes. Keep the scene's emotional tone.
```

---

### Season Swap — Summer to Winter

**Prompt:**
```
Change the season to deep winter without altering any camera movement or subject motion. Replace all foliage with snow-covered bare branches, add a thin layer of snow on every horizontal surface, breath mist visible on exhale, overcast diffuse light replacing direct sun, desaturated cool color grade. Keep all characters and objects identical.
```

---

### Cinematic Color Regrade — Teal & Orange

**Prompt:**
```
Apply a professional teal-and-orange cinematic color grade to the entire clip. Push shadows toward teal-green, warm skin tones and highlights toward amber-orange, reduce overall saturation by 15%, add subtle film grain and very slight vignette. Do not alter timing, framing, or subject motion.
```

---

### Era Transfer — Modern to 1970s Film

**Prompt:**
```
Re-render the clip as if shot on 16mm film in 1975. Add heavy film grain, faded color with lifted blacks, slight magenta-green color shift, occasional light leak on the right edge, soft focus halation around bright areas, and a very subtle flicker on brightness. Preserve all motion and action exactly.
```

---

### Environment Swap — Interior to Rooftop

**Prompt:**
```
Keep the subject and all their motion identical but replace the background environment with a sunlit urban rooftop at golden hour. City skyline visible in the background, warm directional rim light matching the new environment falling on the subject, soft atmospheric haze. Seamless integration — no compositing artifacts.
```

---

### Slow-Motion Remix

**Prompt:**
```
Apply a 2× slow-motion effect to the entire clip. Add subtle motion blur on fast-moving elements, slightly boost color saturation to compensate for the reduced temporal energy, keep the first and last frames as freeze-frame holds for 0.5 s each. Audio pacing should match the new speed.
```

---

### Add Weather — Rain on a Dry Scene

**Prompt:**
```
Add heavy rainfall to the existing scene without altering any subject motion or framing. Streaks of rain fall at a 10° angle in the foreground and midground, puddles form on the ground and show ripple rings, wet sheen on all surfaces, slightly desaturate and cool the color temperature by 500K. Rain should look photorealistic, not composited.
```

---

## Conversational Edits & Remixes

Google Gemini Omni's killer feature is chat-style iterative editing. Use these as follow-up prompts after a first generation.

### Mood Shift

**Prompt:**
```
Keep everything the same but make it golden hour instead of midday, warmer color temperature, longer shadows, soft volumetric god rays through the window.
```

---

### Subject Swap (Preserve Motion)

**Prompt:**
```
Same shot, same camera move, same lighting — but replace the woman with a man in his 50s wearing a navy peacoat. Keep all action and timing identical.
```

---

### Time Remap

**Prompt:**
```
Slow down the final 3 seconds to half speed, add subtle motion blur, keep the first 5 seconds at original speed. End on a freeze-frame of the last clear frame.
```

---

### Style Transfer From Reference Image

**Reference:** a stylized art piece.
**Prompt:**
```
Re-render the previous clip in the visual style of the attached image — match its color palette, brush texture, and lighting language. Preserve the original motion, framing, and subject identity exactly.
```

---

### Background Replacement

**Prompt:**
```
Same subject, same lighting on the subject — but replace the background with a snowy mountain ridge at dusk. Add gentle snowfall in front of and behind the subject for parallax depth. Match the new background's color cast onto the rim light of the subject's face.
```

---

## Audio-Driven & Lip-Sync

Provide an audio file to drive lip-sync and timing.

### Voice-Over to Talking Head

**References:** character image + audio file (voice line).
**Prompt:**
```
Use the attached image as the speaker and the attached audio as their voice. Generate a clean medium-close talking-head shot, eye-level, soft key light. Sync mouth shapes exactly to the audio phonemes, natural micro head movements and blinks, warm conference-room background slightly out of focus. Duration matches the audio. 16:9, broadcast quality.
```

---

### Music Video Mood Cut

**References:** character image + music track.
**Prompt:**
```
Generate a moody music video using the attached portrait as the artist and the attached track as the audio. The artist sings the lyrics with accurate lip-sync, intercut with abstract B-roll: smoke curling in red light, rain on a windshield, a city skyline at twilight. Match cuts to the song's downbeats. Duration matches the audio. 9:16 vertical, cinematic color.
```

---

### Sound-Driven Dance Loop

**References:** character image + 4-second drum loop.
**Prompt:**
```
Use the attached character. Generate a perfectly looped 4-second dance clip synced to the attached beat — feet hit on the kick, shoulders pop on the snare. Black infinity background with hard rim lights, slow camera orbit one full rotation. Seamless loop start-to-end. 9:16.
```

---

## Resources & API Docs

### Prompt Engineering Tips for Google Gemini Omni

1. **Lead with cinematography vocabulary** — Specify lens (35mm, anamorphic, macro), camera move (dolly-in, crane, Steadicam, locked-off), and lighting (golden hour, volumetric, hard rim).
2. **Structure as Subject → Motion → Camera → Mood** — Keep each layer explicit; Google Gemini Omni follows multi-clause prompts reliably.
3. **Anchor identity with reference images** — For any character or product, attach a reference and write *"use the attached image as the subject, preserve face/label/colorway exactly."*
4. **Use explicit durations and timestamps** — `0–4s wide shot, 4–8s push-in, 8–12s close-up` gives Omni a cut list to follow.
5. **Specify aspect ratio in-prompt as a backup** — Even if you set it in the API, mention `9:16 vertical` in the text too.
6. **Negative cues work** — Add `no captions, no watermark, no morphing` to suppress common artifacts.
7. **For consistency across scenes** — Repeat the identity descriptor in each scene block ("same woman in the same red coat") rather than relying on coreference.
8. **For edits, isolate what's changing** — *"Keep everything identical except…"* outperforms re-describing the whole scene.

### Audio Profile & Character

Create reusable voice profiles and characters to reference in your video generations:

```python

)
profile = api.wait_for_completion(job["request_id"])
profile_id = profile["outputs"][0]             # use this ID in audio_ids

# ── Create a character ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
char_image_url = api.upload_file("hero_portrait.png")

)
character = api.wait_for_completion(job["request_id"])
character_id = character["outputs"][0]         # use this ID in character_ids

# ── Use character + audio in a video generation ──────────────────────────────

### REST API Reference

All endpoints follow the same submit → poll pattern:

```
POST https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/{endpoint}   →  {"request_id": "abc123", "status": "processing"}
GET  https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/predictions/{request_id}/result  →  poll until status == "completed"
```
